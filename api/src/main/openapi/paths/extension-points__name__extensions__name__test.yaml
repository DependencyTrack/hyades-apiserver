    Tests an extension.
    
    If the extension is configurable (i.e. `/config-schema` returns status `200`),
    a valid configuration **must** be provided in the test request.
    The configuration is validated against the applicable JSON schema.
    
    **Do not use clear text credentials in the supplied config**.
    Fields annotated with `x-secret-ref` in the config schema expect
    a name of a managed secret, which is resolved internally by the API.
    
    Test results contain one or more checks, each of which can have a status of
    `PASSED`, `FAILED`, or `SKIPPED`. If *at least one* check is `FAILED`,
    the entire test should be considered `FAILED`.
    
    Requires the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` or `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION_UPDATE` permission.
