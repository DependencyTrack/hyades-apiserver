  operationId: getWorkflowInstance
  summary: Get a workflow instance
  description: |-
    Returns run metadata of a given workflow instance.
    
    Multiple runs can share an instance ID, but only a single run can exist
    in non-terminal state at any given time. Thus, this operation only
    returns metadata if a run in non-terminal state exists.
    
    To list all runs for an instance ID, including terminated ones,
    use the `/workflow-runs` endpoint and filter by `workflow_instance_id`.
    
    **Note:** This is an internal API endpoint and may change without notice.
    
    Requires the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` or `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION_READ` permission.
