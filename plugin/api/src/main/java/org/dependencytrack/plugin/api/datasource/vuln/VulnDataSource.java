/**
 * A source of vulnerability intelligence data.
 * <p>
 * Data is exchanged in the CycloneDX Bill of Vulnerabilities (BOV) format.
 *
 * <h3>Expected BOV content</h3>
 * Each BOV must contain <em>at most</em> one vulnerability.
 * <p>
 * CPE and PURL coordinates of affected components may be communicated by linking
 * to component items within the same BOV, using BOM refs.
 * <p>
 * If CPEs and PURLs contain versions (e.g. {@code pkg:maven/foo/bar@1.2.3}),
 * those versions are overwritten by the {@code affects} version that links to them.
 *
 * <h3>Custom properties</h3>
 * Sources may populate the {@code dependency-track:vuln:title} property
 * to communicate a short, human-friendly title.
 *
 * <h3>Valid example BOV</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   "components": [
 *     {
 *       "bom-ref": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
 *       "name": "acme-lib",
 *       "purl": "pkg:maven/com.acme/acme-lib"
 *     }
 *   ],
 *   "vulnerabilities": [
 *     {
 *       "id": "CVE-123",
 *       "source": {
 *         "name": "NVD"
 *       },
 *       "affects": [
 *         {
 *           "ref": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
 *           "versions": [
 *             {
 *               "version": "1.2.3"
 *             },
 *             {
 *               "range": "vers:maven/>=2.0.0|<3.2.1"

 *           ]
 *         }
 *       ]
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Expected {@link Iterator} behavior</h3>
 * It is expected that sources make an effort to keep as little data as possible
 * in memory, and lazily retrieve new data as {@link Iterator#hasNext()} is invoked.
 * <p>
 * Sources may deviate from this behavior to improve performance by buffering,
 * or to avoid rate limiting of external APIs.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/bov/">CycloneDX BOV</a>
 * @since 5.7.0
