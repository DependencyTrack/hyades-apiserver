/**
 * A key-value store for extensions.
 * <p>
 * Extensions that need to maintain state can use this store for persistence.
 * <p>
 * A store instance is scoped to a single extension.
 * Access to other extensions' values is not possible.
 * <p>
 * Entries in the store are versioned, enabling optimistic concurrency control
 * via {@link #compareAndPut(String, String, Long)} and {@link #compareAndDelete(String, long)}.
 * <p>
 * Performing write operations (puts, deletes) in high frequency should be
 * avoided if possible to reduce I/O overhead. Bulk operations ({@link #putMany(Map)},
 * {@link #getMany(Collection)}, {@link #deleteMany(Collection)}) should be
 * preferred over their singular counterparts, as they are more efficient.
 * They are however not concurrency-safe.
