     * <h4>Input</h4>
     * <p>
     * The input is a CycloneDX BOM representing a project's components.
     * Components MAY have the fields indicated by the analyzer's
     * {@link VulnAnalyzerFactory#analyzerRequirements()}, but this is not guaranteed.
     * Components can have more or fewer fields. It is the responsibility of the analyzer
     * to determine which components it can work with and which it should ignore.
     * <p>
     * Components may include a {@code dependencytrack:internal:is-internal-component} property.
     * When present, the component is internal and its data MUST NOT be sent to external services.
     * The mere presence of the property is suffices, the value is irrelevant. Example:
     * <pre>{@code
     * {
     *   "components": [
     *     {
     *       "bomRef": "ab84cf35-82a1-4341-a70f-0e8c9138e3c4",
     *       "type": "CLASSIFICATION_LIBRARY",
     *       "name": "acme-lib",
     *       "version": "1.0.0",
     *       "purl": "pkg:maven/com.acme/acme-lib@1.0.0",
     *       "properties": [
     *         {
     *           "name": "dependencytrack:internal:is-internal-component"
     *         }
     *       ]
     *     },
     *     {
     *       "bomRef": "cd72ef49-93b2-4452-b81e-1a9249fce4b5",
     *       "type": "CLASSIFICATION_LIBRARY",
     *       "name": "jackson-databind",
     *       "version": "2.18.0",
     *       "purl": "pkg:maven/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind@2.18.0",
     *       "cpe": "cpe:2.3:a:fasterxml:jackson-databind:2.18.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"

     * <h4>Output</h4>
     * <p>
     * The output is a CycloneDX VDR. It must contain {@code vulnerabilities} with
     * {@link VulnerabilityAffects} entries referencing affected components via their {@code bomRef}.
     * BOM refs should be treated as opaque strings, and analyzers should not make assumptions
     * about their format. Example:
     * <pre>{@code
     * {
     *   "vulnerabilities": [
     *     {
     *       "id": "CVE-2024-1234",
     *       "source": {
     *         "name": "NVD",
     *         "url": "https://nvd.nist.gov/"
     *       },
     *       "affects": [
     *         {
     *           "ref": "cd72ef49-93b2-4452-b81e-1a9249fce4b5"
     *         }
     *       ]
     *     }
     *   ]
     * }
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param bom the CycloneDX BOM to analyze.
     * @return A CycloneDX VDR containing discovered vulnerabilities.
